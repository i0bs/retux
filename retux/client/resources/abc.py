class Snowflake:
    """
    Represents an unique identifier for a Discord resource.

    ---

    Discord utilizes Twitter's snowflake format for uniquely identifiable descriptors
    (IDs). These IDs are guaranteed to be unique across all of Discord, except in some
    unique scenarios in which child objects share their parent's ID.

    ---

    Attributes
    ----------
    _snowflake : `str`, optional
        The internally stored snowflake. Snowflakes are always in string-form.

        The snowflake may only be `None` in the event that a given
        field in a resource does not supply it. This should not be always
        taken for granted as having a value. Please use the representation
        of the class itself.

    Methods
    -------
    timestamp : `datetime.datetime`
        The timestamp of the snowflake as a UTC-native datetime.

        Timestamps are denoted as milliseconds since the Discord Epoch:
        the first second of 2015, or or `1420070400000`.
    worker_id : `int`
        The internal worker ID of the snowflake.
    process_id : `int`
        The internal process ID of the snowflake.
    increment : `int`
        The internal incrementation number of the snowflake.

        This value will only increment when a process has been
        generated on this snowflake, e.g. a resource.
